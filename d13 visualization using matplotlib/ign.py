Name:
    IGN Analysis
Filename:
    ign.py
Problem Statement:
    Read the ign.csv file and perform the following task :

        Let's say we want to find games released for the Xbox One
        that have a score of more than 7.

    review distribution for the Xbox One vs the review distribution
    for the PlayStation 4.We can do this via a histogram, which will plot the
    frequencies for different score ranges.



Hint:

    The columns contain information about that game:

        score_phrase — how IGN described the game in one word.
        This is linked to the score it received.
        title — the name of the game.
        url — the URL where you can see the full review.
        platform — the platform the game was reviewed on (PC, PS4, etc).
        score — the score for the game, from 1.0 to 10.0.
        genre — the genre of the game.
        editors_choice — N if the game wasn't an editor's choice, Y if it was. This is tied to score.
        release_year — the year the game was released.
        release_month — the month the game was released.
        release_day — the day the game was released.
